# COMP430-CourseProject
This repository contains the source code of our course project
for the Data Privacy and Security course (COMP430).

### Backend

The backend of the project is coded in Java with Spring Boot. It also requires a local 
instance of MySQL to be running on the same host at port 3307, and a database with the name 
'comp430' to be included (both of which can be configured in the application properties).

After doing the necessary configurations, the backend project can simply be run as an Application.
The application will boot in about 10 seconds and will be serving port 8080 of the localhost.
