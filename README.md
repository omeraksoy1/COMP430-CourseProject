# COMP430-CourseProject
This repository contains the source code of our course project
for the Data Privacy and Security course (COMP430).

## Backend

The backend of the project is coded in Java with Spring Boot. It also requires a local 
instance of MySQL to be running on the same host at port 3307, and a database with the name 
'comp430' to be included (both of which can be configured in the application properties).

After doing the necessary configurations, the backend project can simply be run as an Application.
The application will boot in about 10 seconds and will be serving port 8080 of the localhost.

## Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.4.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
